Searching - Search for Range

1. Set left, right and middle pointers
    1.1 left or l is the the first index which is 0
    1.2 right or r is the last index which is the lenght of the array minus 1
    1.3 set middle by adding left and right, divide by 2 and take the integer part
    1.4 create a loop that continues to run as long as l is less than r

2. Three things can happen to the number at index m, it can be either equal, less than or greater than target

    2.1 If the number at index m is equal to our target number
        2.1.1 check if m is zero, meaning is it at the beginning of the array, if it is, that's the end we have found our first index
        2.1.2 this is a sorted array, the number before it can either be less or equal
        2.1.2 if the number before it is less, thats the end we have found our left most range
        2.1.3 if the number before it is equal move r to the number before it and continue

    2.2 if the number at index m is less than target
        2.2.1 since the array is sorted it means all number before m are smaller than target
        2.2.2 move l to the index after m and continue

    2.3 if the number at index m is greater than target
        2.3.1 It means all the numbers after m are greater than target too
        2.3.2 move r to the index before m and continue

3. if after going through we don't find our target just end the process and return -1 and -1

4. Repeat this process all over again for the right most index while inverting all the factors
